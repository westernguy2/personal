            <p>
                Hi! I'm Kunal Agarwal, a student at UC Berkeley born and raised in the Bay Area looking for an internship opportunity for next summer. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Last summer I interned at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the Scientific Data Management Research Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also enthusiastic about teaching computer science! After taking CS 61A, I helped give back to the course by academic interning and 1 on 1 tutoring. I mentored for Computer Science Mentors (CSM) and was a part of course staff for CS 61A as a tutor. I am currently a TA for Data 100, the upper division course for principles and techniques of data science.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                I found the ability to assist other students the most fulfilling way to make use of my expertise in the material, and tutoring and assisting in labs allowed me to understand the material from a new multiplicity of perspectives when I considered how I could best convey concepts to each individual student.

            <p>
                In the Summer of 2019, I had the pleasure of participating in an internship at one of the Department of Energy’s National Labs, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in the Berkeley Lab Undergraduate Research (BLUR) program. I worked under Alex Sim and John Wu in the Scientific Data Management Research group in the Computational Research Division at Berkeley Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on a data compression software called the Implementation of Dynamic Extensible Adaptive Locally Exchangeable Measures (IDEALEM). The software, written in C, originally was functional, but limited in its functionality. I worked on expanding the boundaries of what a user could do with the software. I implemented functionality for more test statistics a user could use and allowed the user to use multi-dimensional data instead of just one-dimensional data. Additionally, I built an API for the software that previously could only be run using command line arguments. The user can then integrate the software into their codebase. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned about how to build a software package with the user in mind. I had to figure out which features the user would most appreciate, how difficult it would be for the user to complete certain tasks, and how to create a level of abstraction so the user doesn’t need to worry about how the software works. I learned about how software engineering in research is done, and I want to continue working on projects that take complicated mathematical/statistical algorithms and relates them to software engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had an incredible experience working at Berkeley Lab. The internship solidified my love for computer science and mathematics and encouraged my desire to pursue these fields. I want to try out other areas of computer science and applied mathematics as I continue to pursue more opportunities and decide what I am truly passionate about.
